        <h3>Pork chive dumplings, one of the most traditional dumplings in China</h3>
        <p>One of the crowd's favorite food. My family used to make them for friends 
            and family on special occasions. It is best served pan fried once it has 
            been cooked thoroughly by boiling or steaming it. Hope you enjoy this recipe!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Meat Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
            <li>2 cup garlic chives finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp regular soy sauce regular kind (not light or dark)</li>
            <li>½ tbsp white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>4 tbsp water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dumpling Wrapper</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup hot boiling water</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp regular soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Chinese black vinegar (or regular vinergar)</li>
            <li>½ tsp sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the Filling ingredients together. Mix very well until it forms a paste. The meat should be broken down and pasty.</li>
            <li>In another large mixing bowl, whisk flour and salt together. Pour hot boiling water into the dry ingredients. Then mix together until it forms a clumpy ball. If the dough is too sticky to work with, sprinkle a few more tablespoons of flour over top and knead it into a ball until it's no longer sticky.</li>
            <li>Flour your working surface. Then pierce a hole into the middle of the dough ball. Then shape it into a very loose circular "hoop". The hoop should be 1.5 inches thick.</li>
            <li>Cut the hoop in half to form two long pieces.</li>
            <li>Then slice those into 1 inch wide pieces or until you have 50 equal sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a ball. Place the balls back into the mixing bowl and cover them with a moist clean towel so they do not dry out.</li>
            <li>Re-flour your surface and roll out one ball at a time with a rolling pin until thin. The wrappers should be about 3 inches wide in diameter.</li>
            <li>Fill your wrapper with a levelled off tablespoon of filling.</li>
            <li>Dab a little bit of water on the edges of the wrapper. Then fold one side over and pinch edges together to seal it.</li>
            <li>Then fold & pinch the edge to create a classic looking dumpling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To Cook Dumplings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a hot non-stick pan set over medium heat, add oil. Lay your dumplings bottom side down. Pour enough water to cover the base of the pan. Cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Steam cook for 12-13 minutes. In the last minute, remove the lid and let any excess water (if any) evaporate so the bottoms of the dumplings can crisp up.</li>
            <li>Serve with dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
